- Correlation isn’t causation
- Lack of correlation isn't lack of causation
-	All supervised models predict, some are interpretable, fewer still are causal
-	A causal (not "casual") model is needed for intervention and counterfactuals
-	Experimental and observational data
-	Project-based to build a portfolio
- Proposed a form of this class a year ago
- Updated proposal with new data
- Class size lets us run a seminar
