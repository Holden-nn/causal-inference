## What is Difference In Differences

- Difference in Differences (DiD) is a causal inference method utilizing observational data
- DiD attempts to recreate an experiment by sorting data in nature into 'treatment' and 'control' groups
    - This is a called a 'natural experiment'
- DiD is built on linear regression, and requires an addtional assumption to ensure the it explains a causal outcome

## DiD Closes Both Backdoors at Once

- We will close the Group backdoor by controlling for group differences (again group is 'treatment' or 'control')
- We will close the Time backdoor by comparing variation within each group over time
- Essentially we are looking for how much MORE the treatment group was impacted over time versus the control group (the difference in differences)

## EX: John Snow's 1855 Proof of Cholera's Source

- John Snow in 1855 found that Cholera was spread via contaminated water and not airborn infection
- London had a major water company Lambeth who was legally required to move their water supply from downstream to upstream between the period from 1849 and 1854
    - Seems like a good instance to test whether drinking contaminated water contributed to Cholera death
- However, if Snow only catalogued the difference in Cholera death rate from 1849 and 1854, he would have no evidence the Lambeth change had caused it
- So Snow collected data on Cholera death rate for two groups: Lambeth customers ('treatment') and other sources ('control')

---

| Source of Water |  Death Rate 1849| Death Rate 1854|
|---------|------:|--------:|
| Non-Lambeth      | 134.9 | 146.6|
| Lambeth     |  130.1|   84.9|
| Death rate is deaths per 10,000 Londoners| 

\

- From 1849 to 1854 Lambeth's death rate fell rapidly by 45.2 deaths per 10,000, impressive, but it could be caused by something else
- Using DiD we get a convincing causal explanation however: (84.9 - 130.1) - (146.6 - 134.9) = -57.1 reduced deaths

---

- The below comes from perhaps the most famous DiD study Card and Kruger 1994.
- In April of 1992, New Jersey's minimum wage increased by $0.80, but no change was made in Pennsylvania
- Card and Krueger surveyed fast food employment in the two states before and after the change in minimum wage
    - Assuming fast food employment shouldn't vary much between the two states without treatment, Pennsylvania will serve as the counterfactual


| | New Jersey | Pennsylvania | Diff |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|February| 20.44 | 23.33 | −2.89|
| November| 21.03| 21.17 | -0.14 |
|Change | 0.59 | -2.16 | 2.75 |   

- The paper famously found (unintuitively) that employment in NJ slightly increased relative to PA (firms increased prices rather than fire employees)

## Using DiD

- The hardest part of implmenting a DiD model is finding a suitable set of 'treatment' and 'control' groups
    - The two groups must have a convincing reason to believe they would act similarly in the case of a counterfactual with no treatment
- Your dataset must include information on these groups and must include time period data for at least two points (pre-treatment and post-treatment)

## Parallel Trends Assumption

- In addition to the traditional linear regression assumptions, to utilize DiD, your data must fit the 'Parallel Trends' assumption
- Parallel Trends Assumption: In the absense of a treatment, the trend/difference between 'treatment' and 'control' would have remained the same
- This assumption is unobservable – you cannot see the counterfactual where the treatment did not occur – but it can be justified 
    - Beyond reasoning which justifies that there are no unobserved cofounders, you can also use prior trends and placebo tests
        - Both of these methods involve showing a parallel trend prior to the 'treatment period'

## Performing DiD: Two Time Periods

$$
Y = \alpha_g + \alpha_t + \beta_1 Treated + \epsilon
$$

- $\alpha_g$ is fixed effects/intercepts for all of your groups
- $\alpha_t$ is fixed effcts/intercepts for your time periods
- $Treated$ is a dummy variable which is true when an observation occurs both:
    - Post Treatment 
    - Within the Treatment group

---

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 TreatedGroup + \beta_2 AfterTreatment + \\
\beta_3 (TreatedGroup \times AfterTreatment) + \epsilon
$$

---

## Performing DiD: Interaction Term with Time

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Time + \beta_2 Treatment +\\ \beta_3 Treatment \times Time + \epsilon
$$

- This regression understands the treatment more as a break in the literal linear trend
- Utilizing many time periods might stress the amount of data you have and introduce noisier results

## Alternatively:

$$
Y = \alpha_g + \alpha_t + \beta_{-T_1} Treated + \beta_{-(T_1 - 1)} Treated + \ldots\\ + B_{-1} Treated + \beta_1 Treated + \ldots\\ \beta_{T_2} Treated + \epsilon
$$

- Where $T_1$ is the number of time periods before treatment, $T_2$ the number of time periods after treatment and $\beta_{n}$ is the DiD calculation at time period $n$
- The betas less than 0 should be close to zero and serve as a form of placebo testing of parallel trends

## Testing Parallel Trends: 

- Utilizing only pretreatment data, we can see if the 'treatment' and 'control' group display parallel trends

$$
Y = \alpha_g + \beta_1 Time + \beta_2 (Time \times Group) + \epsilon
$$

- If the coefficient for $\beta_2$ is already large without including the post-treatment time periods, then you likely do not have parallel trends

## Performing DiD: Utilizing Covariates?

- Perhaps our DAG or our analysis of prior trends will indicate that the parallel trends assumption might not hold
- This might be a sign to utilize a different method/dataset, but Covariates could be utilized instead to demonstrate that, controlling for an additional factor, parallel trends hold
- There inclusion can get thorny though, and might undermine our assumptions or our treatment results
