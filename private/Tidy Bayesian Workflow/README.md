Projects
================

## Project Organization

Each of your projects will have a similar organization. There are
certain limitations on the size and type of files that can be pushed to
GitHub. There are also certain things that shouldnâ€™t be accessible by
the public (e.g., data we have a license to access). For these reasons,
we have folders and files that are pushed to GitHub and those that are
not.

### Pushed to GitHub

  - `/Code` Each script should do something specific (like tidyverse
    functions), have a descriptive name, and include number prefixes if
    they are meant to be run in a certain order (e.g.,
    `01_import_data.R`, `02_clean_data.R`).
  - `/Data` While all data live here, only data that are small and can
    be shared publically will be pushed.
  - `/Figures` Figures live here, including images (saved as PNG files)
    and data referenced or used for tables, for use in the `README` and
    report.
  - `/Report` The report, without any PDF knits.
  - `README` This page, with any other organization details to make it
    easy to navigate your repository.

### Not Pushed to GitHub

  - `/Output` Output from model runs. These files tend to be too large.
    They are also something each user can create on their own.

## Project Workflow

  - Use RStudio projects.
  - Use `here::here()` to specify files paths.
  - Use tidyverse functions as much as possible.
  - Try and follow the [tidyverse style
    guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
  - For the inference project, use [A Tidy Bayesian
    Workflow](tidy-bayesian-workflow.md) as a reference for iterative
    steps.

workflow, see [Using
